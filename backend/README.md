## üöÄ Pre-Demo Setup (Do This Once)

### Step 1: Start the Magic System
```bash
# Open terminal and run:
cd /home/snebo/repo/ivr_solution
npm run start:dev
```
**Wait for:** `Application is running on: http://localhost:3000` ‚úÖ

### Step 2: Create Scripts (What the AI will say)
```bash
# Run this command:
node scripts/create-sample-scripts.js
```
**You'll see:** ‚úÖ Sample scripts created successfully ‚úÖ

### Step 3: Find Some Businesses
```bash
# Copy and paste this entire command:
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/scraper/scrape \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "businessType": "hospitals",
    "location": "Houston, TX",
    "industry": "healthcare",
    "limit": 5
  }'
```
**You'll see:** A list of hospitals with phone numbers üè•

## üé¨ Live Demo (Show This to People)

### Step 1: Show What Businesses We Found
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/scraper/businesses/with-scripts
```
**Explain:** "The AI found these businesses automatically from the internet"

### Step 2: Give Instructions to AI
```bash
# Pick a business ID from above and run:
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/scraper/businesses/19bb8c5e-8b43-4de0-95c5-4bb52becce4b/assign-script \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "scriptId": "2624fd50-dbd5-4964-ad37-cda0d84de619",
    "customGoal": "Find the cardiology department and ask about appointment availability"
  }'
```
**Explain:** "I just told the AI what to do when it calls this hospital"

### Step 3: Show Businesses Ready for Calling
```bash
curl "http://localhost:3000/scraper/businesses/with-scripts?hasScript=true&hasPhone=true"
```
**Explain:** "These businesses have phone numbers and the AI knows what to say"

### Step 4: **THE MAGIC MOMENT** - Make a Live Call
```bash
# üö® IMPORTANT: Replace the phone number with a VERIFIED number in your Twilio account
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/telephony/call \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "phoneNumber": "+1[YOUR_VERIFIED_NUMBER]",
    "scriptId": "2624fd50-dbd5-4964-ad37-cda0d84de619",
    "goal": "Navigate to cardiology department"
  }'
```
**You'll get:** A call ID like `CA1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef`

### Step 5: Watch the AI Think (Real-time Magic) üß†
```bash
# Replace {callSid} with the actual call ID from above:
curl http://localhost:3000/telephony/call/{callSid}
```

**In the terminal where npm is running, you'll see:**
- ü§ñ AI ANALYZING IVR MENU
- üéØ AI DECISION MADE  
- ‚úÖ Selected Option: 2
- üß† Reasoning: "This option leads to patient services"
- üí¨ Response: "Pressing 2 to reach patient services"

**Explain:** "The AI is listening to the phone menu, understanding the options, and deciding what button to press!"

### Step 6: Show What Happened
```bash
# Check the call results:
curl http://localhost:3000/telephony/call/{callSid}
```
**You'll see:** Complete transcript, decisions made, and call outcome

## üé≠ Demo Script for Presentation

### **Opening (30 seconds)**
"Today I'll show you an AI that can call businesses and navigate their phone systems like a human. It listens, understands, and makes decisions automatically."

### **Business Discovery (1 minute)**
"First, let me show you how it finds businesses..."
- Run the scraper command
- Show the results: "It found 5 hospitals with phone numbers automatically"

### **Script Assignment (1 minute)**  
"Now I'll tell the AI what to do when it calls..."
- Run the script assignment  
- Explain: "I just gave it a goal: find the cardiology department"

### **The Magic Call (3-5 minutes)**
"Now watch the AI make a real phone call..."
- Make the call
- Show the live terminal output
- Point out: "See how it's analyzing the menu options?"
- Point out: "Now it's deciding which button to press!"
- Point out: "It pressed 2 because it understood that leads to patient services!"

### **Results (1 minute)**
"Let me show you what it learned..."
- Show the call transcript
- Explain the decisions made
- Show how everything is saved

### **Closing (30 seconds)**
"This AI can scale to call hundreds of businesses simultaneously, each with different goals, navigating complex phone systems autonomously."
